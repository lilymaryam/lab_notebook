# Systematic Detection of Mutation Spectrum Shifts Across Diverse Viruses

# 20260122 - Getting data from start to finish of spectrum splits.
currently i am focusing solely on getting a comprehensive set of splits and mutation spectra for measles. i need to 
 
- [ ] figure out if bootstraps are useful or uninformative (they may be a problem if data set is too small)
- [X] create a minimum mutation cutoff for checking nodes for splits
- [X] create a maximum chi cutoff for choosing splits
- [ ] check all thresholds to make sure they are customizable for different data sizes
- [ ] run root based mutation spectra for all data (don't check for splits)
- [ ] figure out how to postprocess and visualize results
- [ ] run a pca on mutation spectra across every virus
- [ ] run a pca on mutation spectra splits within a virus
- [ ] run a pca on mutation spectra splits across all viruses
